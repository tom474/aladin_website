                Our team of professional, RMIT based receptionists will ensure
                every one of your calls is answered with a smile. Live Text is a
                new feature in Aladin that reads text in images just as it would
                on a website, in a note, or in a text input field. This means
                you can highlight text, copy and paste it, search for it, and
                even translate it. Live Text support plays an important role in
                modern customer service. Live Text messaging is a huge part of
                how customers communicate today.

        <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          You don’t need content for content’s sake. Content should support and
          drive business goals—like adding new customers and revenue. We’ll work
          with you to identify your target audience, define content pillars,
          creating a content calendar, and figure out an effective distribution
          plan. You’ll get a clear plan to meaningful results, not just a
          e-commerce website that sits there collecting dust.
        </p>
        <h2>Content Writing - blogs, case studies, and more</h2>
        <p>
          Run-of-the-mill content doesn’t cut is like shouting in the front row
          at a rock concert. But your prospects and customers want to see that
          you know your stuff (and so does Google). We’ll help you keep your
          blog filled with fresh and relevant content written by true CX pros.
          And when you’ve got customers knocking it out of the park, you need to
          tell those stories. Case studies are the best marketing tactic to
          increase sales for B2B companies. We’ll help you tell those stories
          and build trust with prospects.

        <h2>LinkedIn Content Repurposing</h2>
        <p>
          SEO may be a long-term growth driver for your business. Repurposing
          your content into LinkedIn posts are how you build an audience,
          demonstrate expertise, and drive short-term results. Our team can take
          your existing content (or new content we’ll write for you) and help
          you get way more mileage out of it. It’s the secret sauce to building
          an audience, driving engagement, and growing your inbound leads.
